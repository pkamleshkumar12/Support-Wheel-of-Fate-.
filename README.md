# Background
All engineers in Company X take it in turns to support the business for half a day at a time. Currently,
generating a schedule that shows who’s turn is it to support the business is being done manually
and we need to automate that!

# Task
Your task is to design and build an online “Support Wheel of Fate”. This should repeat selecting two
engineers at random to both complete a half day of support (shift) each to ultimately generate a
schedule that shows whose turn is it to support the business.

# Assumptions
You can assume that Company X has 10 engineers.
You can assume that the schedule will span two weeks and start on the first working day of the
upcoming week.

# Rules
An engineer can do at most one half day shift in a day.
An engineer cannot have half day shifts on consecutive days.
Each engineer should have completed one whole day of support in any 2 week period.
